The code in this "state_measures" folder was written by [Ole Agersnap (Princeton)](https://www.nber.org/people/agersnap).
It is independent of the code that produces results appearing in Dingel & Neiman (2020).
Ole kindly gifted this code to the research community:
"I think other researchers might find state-level data useful.  For that reason, if you want to add state-level data to your GitHub package, I figured I would save you the work of having to write it yourself."
